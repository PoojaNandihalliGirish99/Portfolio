                <h1>Marathons for beginners</h1>
            <small>December, 2020</small>
            <hr>
            <h4>What is a marathon?</h4>
            <p>The marathon is long-distance race or usually called a road race. Usually the race would be to cover the distance of more than 3km and varies depending on the organizers.</p>
            <h4>Who can participate?</h4>
            <p>Anyone can run a marathon. It is a beautiful experience you should try for once. For some it might be miserable but, it depends later if you would wish to run more marathons, I am always ready to participate.</p>
            <h4>It's a race, are you not planning to win?</h4>
            <p>You can set your goal to win them. All you have to do it practice and progress. <em>That would be an 
                unforgettable win!!</em></p>
            <h4>My Experience</h4>
            <p>I ran my first marathon race a 5km run, when I was 19 years, till then I was a untrained sprinter.haha.
                 Now, when I ran for the first 20 minutes, I was tired and physically ready to quit it. 
                But then, a sudden thought in my brain which never wishes to give up, <em>"Finish the cross line".</em> 
                And, then there were check points where I took 1 or 2 minute breaks and some energy supplements.
                 I finally crossed the finish line after walking for the distance of last 5 minutes.</p><p>You can't 
                     believe that just after 5 minutes break, everyone of us started dancing to the DJ. 
                     It was such an amazing experience. And later I ran 7km and 10km races. Totally 4 till now,
                      waiting and excited for my next one! </p>
            <blockquote>Finishing would give a sense of achievement and confidence. You could say 'I did it!'. It is not about winning or losing, it's about not-quitting. Know the importance of finishing what you have started.</blockquote>
